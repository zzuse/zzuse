This is a GitHub Actions workflow that generates an animated snake game visualization of your GitHub contribution graph. Here's how it works:

Workflow Triggers
	Schedule: Runs automatically every 24 hours (cron: "0 */24 * * *")
	Manual: Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
	Push: Runs when code is pushed to the main branch

Job Steps
	Step 1: Generate Snake Animation
	Uses the Platane/snk action to create two SVG files:

	github-contribution-grid-snake.svg - Light theme version
	github-contribution-grid-snake-dark.svg - Dark theme version
	The snake "eats" the contribution squares from your GitHub profile, creating an animated visualization.

	Step 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages
	Uses crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages to:

	Push the generated SVG files to an output branch
	Makes them accessible via GitHub Pages
Usage
	Once running, you can embed the snake animation in your README using:
	The workflow automatically updates the animation daily to reflect your latest contributions.

Platane/snk action contains a GitHub Action that generates a snake game animation from a user's GitHub contribution grid. Here's what it does:

Core Functionality

	Fetches GitHub Contributions: Uses the GitHub API to retrieve a user's contribution calendar data (the green squares you see on GitHub profiles)

	Converts to Game Grid: Transforms the contribution data into a game grid where each contribution square becomes a cell that can be "eaten" by the snake

	Solves Snake Path: Uses sophisticated algorithms (in packages/solver/) to compute the optimal path for a snake to traverse the grid and "eat" all the contribution squares in an orderly fashion

	Generates Visual Output: Creates animated visualizations in two formats:

	SVG: Scalable vector graphics with CSS animations
	GIF: Animated GIF files

Key Components

	packages/action/: Main GitHub Action implementation
	packages/solver/: Algorithm to find the best snake route through the contribution grid
	packages/github-user-contribution/: Fetches GitHub user contribution data
	packages/svg-creator/: Creates SVG animations
	packages/gif-creator/: Creates GIF animations
	packages/types/: TypeScript type definitions

Usage

	The action is designed to be used in GitHub workflows to automatically generate snake animations for GitHub profile READMEs. Users can:
	Specify color palettes (github, github-dark, github-light)
	Customize snake and dot colors
	Generate multiple output formats simultaneously
	Run on schedules to keep animations updated
	Technical Implementation

	Docker-based: Runs in a Docker container due to native library requirements for GIF generation
	Monorepo structure: Organized as a workspace with multiple packages
	TypeScript: Written entirely in TypeScript with proper type definitions
	Modular design: Each functionality is separated into focused packages
	This creates those popular animated snake visualizations you often see on GitHub profile READMEs, where a snake appears to "eat" through someone's contribution history in an entertaining way.
